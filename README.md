Project Description:
The project involves creating a 2-3 tree structure, referred to as a "Tree," and provides a menu-driven interface for users to interact with it. A 2-3 tree, also known as a 2-3 search tree, is a self-balancing, multiway tree data structure that is used to maintain a sorted set of elements, typically in the form of keys and associated values. The name "2-3 tree" refers to the two possible types of nodes in the tree: nodes can have either two elements (2-node) or three elements (3-node). The tree is designed to store and manage movie titles as strings. The main functionalities of the project include inserting movie titles into the tree, removing movie titles, searching for movie titles, and printing the tree in different traversal orders (pre-order, in-order, and post-order). The tree is unique in that each node can hold two movie titles, and the tree is balanced dynamically as new titles are inserted. The project demonstrates principles of tree manipulation and user interaction through a command-line menu.
